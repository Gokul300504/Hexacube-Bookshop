# Hexacube-Bookshop
This is a python based project built mainly using pandas matplotlib and data sets which helps in redefining a traditional bookshop.The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the books, customer, stock, and payment. This application provides a user-friendly environment that provides even less computer- experienced users with selecting books of their interest in seconds. The users can register with their details and can login with their username and passwords on their repeated visits. Users can go through the available books, order their book of choice and the payment can be done on delivery. The frames are created by using PYTHON and PANDAS provides the table storing the data of the users.
